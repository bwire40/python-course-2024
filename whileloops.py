"""A while loop in Python repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition evaluates to True. It
continues iterating until the condition becomes False. The basic syntax of a while loop in Python is as follows:"""
counter = 1
while counter < 10:
    print(counter)
    counter = counter + 1
