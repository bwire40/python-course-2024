"""The for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a
block of code for each element in the sequence"""
# for loops
fruits = ['mango', 'apples', 'banana', 'peas', 'peaches']

# loop through the list and print each item in the list
for fruit in fruits:
    print(f'{fruit}')


# # loop in range
# for i in range(20):
#     print(i + 1)   # prints 1-20
