"""
Tuples are another data structure in Python,
similar to lists, but with one key difference:
tuples are immutable, meaning once they are created, their contents cannot be changed.
This immutability makes tuples suitable for storing collections of items
that should not be modified, such as coordinates, database records, or function arguments.
Tuples are defined using parentheses () and consist of comma-separated elements.

numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4)
# print(type(numbers))  # tuple

# can access items using indexes like lists
